# Weathery tik tak toe

Created with CodeSandbox

This game is your usual tik tak toe but with a little twist.

You won't play with "X" and "0". This game will change your player's emoji depending on the actual weather of Guadalajara.

It uses the open-meteo.com API to import weather data and decide which emojis to show while you play.
